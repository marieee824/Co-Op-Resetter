# Co Op Resetter
 An automatic, cross platform resetter for minecraft java speedruns
 To use, run the jar file, and then do the stuff it tells you to. For now, if you want to use a seed you need to clone the repo and build it yourself because i dont wanna make a full release just for that, since i messed up lol
